Sample Execution Format: ./master -n processCount -s childrenCount
========================================================================

There are 2 files named master.c and worker.c

SHared_mem.h is a header file that holds the structure of a clock.

To run the project cd to bachina.2 folder: make all, All the executables will be generated.

and then give the command ./master -n processesCOunt -s childrenCount

To remove the object files give command make clean

All the outputs for different conditions are written into the ANswers.

Tested the Program termination using sleep function in Master. Master has a sleep(1) which is commented for testing purpose.
